The model is trained on over 1,100 days of EEG data from 14,979 participants using a two-stage masked prediction approach with k-means clustering. The architecture uses a transformer-based design with eight EEG channels, optimized for real-time operation with minimal preprocessing. The model demonstrates strong performance on standard BCI tasks (P300, motor imagery) and shows ability to learn individual variability and alpha rhythm features, though it doesn't yet exceed state-of-the-art results on BCI benchmarks.",

The survey highlights how transformer-based architectures adapted through fine-tuning, few-shot, and zero-shot learning have enabled EEG-based models to perform complex tasks such as natural language generation, semantic interpretation, and diagnostic assistance. By presenting a structured overview of modeling strategies, system designs, and application areas, this work serves as a foundational resource for future work to bridge natural language processing and neural signal analysis through language models.",

The second stage uses a multi-scale EEGSSM architecture that combines structured global convolution with sliding window attention to efficiently capture both sparse long-range and local dependencies, reflecting the brain's small-world topology.

The model demonstrates expert-level performance in seizure detection across multiple institutional datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on four Brain TreeBank iEEG decoding tasks.

The model introduces two key innovations: Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST), which aggregates multi-scale features from localized temporal windows and anatomical brain regions into compact scale-aware tokens, and Structured Sparse Attention (SSA), which captures cross-window and cross-region dependencies while eliminating spurious correlations. These components are alternately stacked to progressively integrate multi-scale dependencies. Extensive experiments across 11 representative EEG tasks and 16 public datasets demonstrate that CSBrain consistently outperforms both task-specific models and strong foundation model baselines, establishing cross-scale modeling as a key inductive bias for generalized EEG decoding.",
