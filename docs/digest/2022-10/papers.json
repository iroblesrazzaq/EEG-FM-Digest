        "detailed_summary": "This paper proposes MAEEG, a masked auto-encoder for EEG representation learning that addresses the challenge of limited labeled EEG data. The model learns representations by reconstructing masked EEG features using a transformer architecture, inspired by both BENDR and computer vision MAE models. The authors demonstrate that MAEEG pretraining significantly improves sleep stage classification accuracy by approximately 5% when only small numbers of labels are available. They also systematically investigate how different masking strategies during pretraining affect downstream performance, finding that higher masking rates with more concentrated masks yield better results.",
