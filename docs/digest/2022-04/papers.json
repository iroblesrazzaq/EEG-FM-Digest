        "detailed_summary": "This paper proposes mulEEG, a novel multi-view self-supervised learning method for unsupervised EEG representation learning. The method aims to effectively utilize complementary information across multiple views (time-series and spectrogram) to learn better representations. The authors introduce a diverse loss function that further encourages complementary information across multiple views. The method with no access to labels beats supervised training while outperforming multi-view baseline methods on transfer learning experiments carried out on sleep-staging tasks. The authors posit that their method was able to learn better representations by using complementary multi-views.",
