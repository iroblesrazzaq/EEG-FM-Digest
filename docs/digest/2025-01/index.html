      <p><strong>Unique contribution:</strong> CEReBrO introduces alternating attention for EEG modeling, achieving 2× speed improvement and 6× memory reduction while maintaining state-of-the-art performance across multiple EEG tasks.</p>
      <details class='summary-detail'><summary>Detailed summary</summary><p>CEReBrO introduces a compact EEG foundation model that addresses key limitations in current approaches: sub-optimal EEG signal modeling, large model sizes, and reliance on private datasets. The model uses a novel tokenization scheme that represents EEG signals at per-channel patch granularity and employs an alternating attention mechanism that jointly models intra-channel temporal dynamics and inter-channel spatial correlations. This design achieves 2× speed improvement with 6× less memory compared to standard self-attention. Pre-trained on over 20,000 hours of publicly available scalp EEG recordings from the Temple University EEG Corpus with diverse channel configurations, CEReBrO sets new benchmarks in emotion detection and seizure detection tasks while maintaining competitive performance in anomaly classification and gait prediction.</p></details>
