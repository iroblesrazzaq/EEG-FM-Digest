    about_blurb: This digest serves as a monthly update on the current EEG foundation model literature on arXiv. We filter with arXiv title and abstract keywords, and a triage LLM to decide on papers that qualify. Then, we generate a summary of the entire paper with an LLM. I manually choose the featured paper of the month.

    intro: This digest serves as a monthly update on the current EEG foundation model literature. I built it so I can keep up to date with the latest EEG FM papers. The process is as follows:
    steps:
      - First we call the arXiv API to retrieve papers with EEG-FM-related terms in their title and abstract.
      - Then, we use an LLM on the title and abstract to triage all papers returned by the arXiv search. The model returns a decision (accept, reject, borderline), its confidence, and 2-4 reasons for its decision.
      - Next, for all models accepted by the triage LLM, we download the PDF, extract text, and run a summary LLM where we extract a summary, bullet points, unique contribution, and tags.
    footer: All triage and summary LLM calls in this profile use the configured OpenAI-compatible endpoint and models.
    limitations:
      - Only checks paper on arXiv.
      - arXiv keyword search may miss papers.
      - Triage LLM could misclassify a paper.
      - Summary LLM is not an expert on the literature, so it relies on the paper to self-identify novelty and importance.
    keyword_subtitle: Matching requires one EEG term plus one FM term set in title/abstract.
